# Day 16 – Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is part of my **90 Days of Code** journey.
It’s a beginner-friendly **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** written in Python where you play against the computer.

The program randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors; you pick your choice; and it tells you who wins each round. Scores are tracked until you type `quit` to exit.

This small project is designed to strengthen your understanding of:

* **Random choices** using Python’s `random` module
* **Loops** for continuous play
* **Conditionals** (`if`/`elif`/`else`) to decide the winner
* **User input** handling

Every line of code is **fully commented** to make it easy for beginners to follow, learn, and modify.
